The normalize.css came from the Treehouse Workspace for the course "HTML Forms" found at https://teamtreehouse.com/library/html-forms/choosing-options/going-further.

I didn't use any large clips that came solely from any one source, but it's easy to see Treehouse's influence in my very newbie-esque coding. Thanks for taking the time to look through it.
